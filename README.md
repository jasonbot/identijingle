# identijingle
Like Identicons, but for SOUND!

We all know [what an identicon is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) whether we know it or not: a unique, reproducible visual representation for some bit of information. Usually you see them used as a default avatar for lazy help vampires on Stack Overflow.

Anyhoo, I ride a lot of public transit and most have some sort of unique sound or jingle that plays before announcements. It's a nice ambient thing that doesn't require your visual attention. I thought, why not have some sort of way of making recognizable chimes for _anything_?

Well, for one thing. To let people know a build was going out, and to associate individual tunes with each project being built.

So yeah now we're here.

Requirements
------------

This thing runs on Python 3. There's a script to spin up a virtual environment.
